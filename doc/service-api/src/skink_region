A region is a set of sensors in the skin, logically grouped together. The regions may overlap. For efficiency reasons, the concept of [sub-regions](skink_sub_region)
are introduced. Therefore, regions do not have direct indices to sensors, but rather to sub-regions.

VARIABLE id: skink_region_id
	The id of this region

	This is the id of the region, which shows its index in `[#regions](skink_data_structures)` of `skink_data_structures`.

VARIABLE sub_region_indices_begin: skink_sub_region_index_id
	Start index of indices to sub-regions in this region

	This is an index to `[#sub_region_indices](skink_data_structures)` of `skink_data_structures` which contains indices to sub-regions of this region.
	The indices to sub-regions of this region are located in indices `\[sub_region_indices_begin, sub_region_indices_begin + [#sub_region_indices_count])`.
	For example, if `sub_region_indices` contains `{0, 1, 4, 2, 4, 7, 3, 2, 5, ...}` and the region has `sub_region_indices_begin = 3` and
	`sub_region_indices_count = 4`, then the region consists of sub-regions `{2, 4, 7, 3}` which are themselves indices to `[#sub_regions]
	(skink_data_structures)` of `skink_data_structures`.

VARIABLE sub_region_indices_count: skink_sub_region_index_size
	Number of sub-regions in this region

	See `[#sub_region_indices_begin]`.
