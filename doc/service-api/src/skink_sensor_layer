Each sensor layer is handled by a network driver, acquiring data at different rates. If the service so chooses, it can provide an [acquire callback](Callbacks#
skink_service_acquire) for each layer so that it would be called by the skin kernel asking the service to read the sensor values. The user-space "sensor type"
refers to the same concept as sensor layer. The `skink_sensor_layer` structure is only partly described here as other parts are either internal to Skinware
or are used elsewhere such as in drivers. It is important for the service to access only the fields described here.

VARIABLE id: skink_sensor_layer_id
	Id of the sensor layer

	This value is the [id](Data Types#skink_sensor_layer_id) of the sensor layer. It is the layer's index in `[#sensor_layers](skink_data_structures)` of
	`skink_data_structures`.

VARIABLE name: char *
	Name of the sensor layer

	This is a string with maximum length [#SKINK_MAX_NAME_LENGTH](constants). It can be compared with a desired name to identify layers of interest.

VARIABLE sensors: skink_sensor *
	Sensors of this layer

	This is the array of [sensors](skink_sensor) of this layer. This array can be accessed by the [acquire callback](Callbacks#skink_service_acquire) to
	read sensor values.

VARIABLE sensors_count: skink_sensor_size
	Number of sensors in this layer

	This value is the size of [#sensors] array.

VARIABLE modules: skink_module *
	Modules of this layer

	This is the array of [modules](skink_module) of this layer. This value is hardware-specific and is present for use of those services that require knowledge
	on the hardware, e.g. a service monitoring hardware for failure.

VARIABLE modules_count: skink_module_size
	Number of modules in this layer

	This value is the size of [#modules] array.

VARIABLE patches: skink_patch *
	Patches of this layer

	This is the array of [patches](skink_patch) of this layer. This value is hardware-specific and is present for use of those services that require knowledge
	on the hardware, e.g. a service monitoring hardware for failure.

VARIABLE patches_count: skink_patch_size
	Number of patches in this layer

	This value is the size of [#patches] array.
