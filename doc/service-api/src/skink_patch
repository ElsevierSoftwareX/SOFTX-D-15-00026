A patch is a set of modules in the skin, managed by a single microcontroller. As far as algorithms over the skin are concerned, details of patches are irrelevant.
However, for those services that need to inspect the hardware itself, the following information are available.

VARIABLE id: skink_patch_id
	The id of this patch

	This is the id of the patch, which shows its index in `[#patches](skink_sensor_layer)` of `skink_sensor_layer` in the [sensor layer](#layer) it belongs to.

VARIABLE layer: skink_sensor_layer_id
	Layer this patch belongs to

	This is an index to `[#sensor_layers](skink_data_structures)` of `skink_data_structures` which shows the [sensor layer](skink_sensor_layer) this patch belongs to.

VARIABLE modules_begin: skink_module_id
	Start index of modules in this patch

	This is an index to `[#modules](skink_sensor_layer)` of `skink_sensor_layer` which contains the modules of this patch. The modules of this patch are located
	in indices `\[modules_begin, modules_begin + [#modules_count])`.

VARIABLE modules_count: skink_module_size
	Number of modules in this patch

	See `[#modules_begin]`.
