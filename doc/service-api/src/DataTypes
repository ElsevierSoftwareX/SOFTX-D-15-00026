The skin kernel defines custom types for the ids and sizes of different structures. These types can have various sizes based on the configuration.
It is recommended that these types be used instead of C's own primitive types.

The types are in pairs of `\*_id` and `\*_size` which are guaranteed to be compatible. So for example a for loop such as the following is immune to
overflows:

	```
	skink_sensor_id    i;
	skink_sensor_size  count = /* get sensor count */;
	for (i = 0; i < count; ++i)
		/* perform operation */
	```

TYPE skink_sensor_id: uint16_t or uint32_t
	Type of sensor id

	The type of sensor ids. If Skinware is configured to support large skins, this type would be `uint32_t`.

TYPE skink_sensor_size: skink_sensor_id
	Type of number of sensors

	This type will be large enough to hold the number of sensors in the skin.

TYPE skink_sensor_response: uint16_t
	Type of sensor response

	The responses of the sensors will have this type. See also `[#SKINK_SENSOR_RESPONSE_MAX](constants)`.

TYPE skink_sensor_layer_id: uint16_t or uint32_t
	Type of sensor layer id

	The type of sensor layer ids. If Skinware is configured to support large skins, this type would be `uint32_t`.

TYPE skink_sensor_layer_size: skink_sensor_layer_id
	Type of number of sensor layers

	This type will be large enough to hold the number of sensor layers in the skin.

TYPE skink_module_id: uint16_t or uint32_t
	Type of module id

	The type of module ids. If Skinware is configured to support large skins, this type would be `uint32_t`.

TYPE skink_module_size: skink_module_id
	Type of number of modules

	This type will be large enough to hold the number of modules in the skin.

TYPE skink_patch_id: uint16_t or uint32_t
	Type of patch id

	The type of patch ids. If Skinware is configured to support large skins, this type would be `uint32_t`.

TYPE skink_patch_size: skink_patch_id
	Type of number of patches

	This type will be large enough to hold the number of patches in the skin.

TYPE skink_sub_region_id: uint16_t or uint32_t
	Type of sub-region id

	The type of sub-region ids. If Skinware is configured to support large skins, this type would be `uint32_t`.

TYPE skink_sub_region_size: skink_sub_region_id
	Type of number of sub-regions

	This type will be large enough to hold the number of sub-regions in the skin.

TYPE skink_region_id: uint16_t or uint32_t
	Type of region id

	The type of region ids. If Skinware is configured to support large skins, this type would be `uint32_t`.

TYPE skink_region_size: skink_region_id
	Type of number of regions

	This type will be large enough to hold the number of regions in the skin.

TYPE skink_region_index_id: uint32_t or uint64_t
	Type of region index id

	The type of region index ids. If Skinware is configured to support large skins, this type would be `uint64_t`.
	Region indices are indices to an array of region ids held by sub-regions, indicating which regions they belong to.

TYPE skink_region_index_size: skink_region_index_id
	Type of number of region indices

	This type will be large enough to hold the number of region indices in the skin. Region indices are indices to an array of
	region ids held by sub-regions, indicating which regions they belong to.

TYPE skink_sub_region_index_id: uint32_t or uint64_t
	Type of sub-region index id

	The type of sub-region index ids. If Skinware is configured to support large skins, this type would be `uint64_t`.
	Sub-region indices are indices to an array of sub-region ids held by regions, indicating which sub-regions they consist of.

TYPE skink_sub_region_index_size: skink_sub_region_index_id
	Type of number of sub-region indices

	This type will be large enough to hold the number of sub-region indices in the skin. Sub-region indices are indices to an array of
	sub-region ids held by regions, indicating which sub-regions they consist of.
