A sub-region is a set of sensors in the skin, logically grouped together. The sub-regions are partitions of regions that do not overlap. They are created for
efficiency reasons. When regions in the skin are defined, they are divided into sub-regions, that are biggest partitions that do not overlap, and regions are
given indices to these sub-regions. The reverse relation is also implemented, where it is known which regions contain a sub-region. [Relationship between regions and
sub-regions](svg files/sub-regions.svg) shows the relationship between regions and sub-regions.

VARIABLE id: skink_sub_region_id
	The id of this sub-region

	This is the id of the sub-region, which shows its index in `[#sub_regions](skink_data_structures)` of `skink_data_structures`.

VARIABLE region_indices_begin: skink_region_index_id
	Start index of indices to regions containing this sub-region

	This is an index to `[#region_indices](skink_data_structures)` of `skink_data_structures` which contains indices to regions of this sub-region. The indices
	to regions containing this sub-region are located in indices `\[region_indices_begin, region_indices_begin + [#region_indices_count])`. For example,
	if `region_indices` contains `{2, 0, 1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 1, 0, ...}` and the sub-region has `region_indices_begin = 3` and
	`region_indices_count = 4`, then the sub-region is contained by regions `{3, 5, 2, 4}` which are themselves indices to `[#regions]
	(skink_data_structures)` of `skink_data_structures`.

VARIABLE region_indices_count: skink_region_index_size
	Number of regions containing this sub-region

	See `[#region_indices_begin]`.

VARIABLE layers: struct skink_sr_layer *
	Layers of the sub-region

	Each sub-region can span over multiple, possibly all layers. This array has the following information for all the
	`[#sensor_layers_count](skink_data_structures)` of `skink_data_structures` layers.

	```
	struct skink_sr_layer
	{
		skink_sensor_id    sensors_begin;
		skink_sensor_size  sensors_count;
	};
	```

	- **`sensors_begin`** and **`sensors_count`**: For each layer, the sensors in the sub-region are located in indices
	  `\[sensors_begin, sensors_begin + sensors_count)` of `[#sensors](skink_sensor_layer)`.
