A module is a set of sensors in the skin, physically grouped together. As far as algorithms over the skin are concerned, details of modules are irrelevant. However,
for those services that need to inspect the hardware itself, the following information are available.

VARIABLE id: skink_module_id
	The id of this module

	This is the id of the module, which shows its index in `[#modules](skink_sensor_layer)` of `skink_sensor_layer` in the [sensor layer](#layer) it belongs to.

VARIABLE layer: skink_sensor_layer_id
	Layer this module belongs to

	This is an index to `[#sensor_layers](skink_data_structures)` of `skink_data_structures` which shows the [sensor layer](skink_sensor_layer) this module belongs to.

VARIABLE patch: skink_patch_id
	Patch this module belongs to

	This is an index to `[#patches](skink_sensor_layer)` of `skink_sensor_layer` which shows the [patch](skink_patch) this module belongs to.

VARIABLE sensors_begin: skink_sensor_id
	Start index of sensors in this module

	This is an index to `[#sensors](skink_sensor_layer)` of `skink_sensor_layer` which contains the sensors of this module. The sensors of this module are located
	in indices `\[sensors_begin, sensors_begin + [#sensors_count])`.

VARIABLE sensors_count: skink_sensor_size
	Number of sensors in this module

	See `[#sensors_begin]`.
