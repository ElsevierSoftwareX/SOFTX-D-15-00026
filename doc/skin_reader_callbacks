This structure is used to provide callbacks to and regarding a reader.

VARIABLE read: (struct skin_reader *, void *, size_t, void *): void
	The callback that reads data

	This callback is called by the reader every time data needs to be read; periodically by a periodic reader,
	on request by a sporadic reader or any time new data is available by a soft reader.
	It is given the reader object, the memory to be read, the [size](skin_writer_attr#buffer_size) of that memory
	and [user provided data](#user_data).

VARIABLE init: (struct skin_reader *, void *): void
	The callback to call when the reader is created

	This callback is called if the reader is successfully created, before the generic reader init [hook](skin_hook)
	is called, and is given the reader object as well as [user provided data](#user_data).

	This callback is optional.

VARIABLE clean: (struct skin_reader *, void *): void
	The callback to call when the reader is removed

	This callback is called when the reader is removed, after the generic reader clean [hook](skin_hook)
	is called, and is given the reader object as well as [user provided data](#user_data).

	**Note**: when this callback is called, the reader task is already removed.  At this point only the [statistics]
	(skin_reader_statistics) are available.

	This callback is optional.

VARIABLE user_data: void *
	User provided data

	This is user provided data, given to all callbacks.
