This is a C++ interface to [callbacks](skin_callback).  The callbacks of the type defined here are given to object iteration
functions as callback.

These functions have the following general form:

```
X::forEachY(SkinCallback<Y> c)
```

and

In this representation, `X` is the class the action originates from and `Y` is what is being iterated.  The
classes that can be iterated are the following.

- `[SkinSensor]`
- `[SkinModule]`
- `[SkinPatch]`
- `[SkinSensorType]`
- `[SkinReader]`
- `[SkinWriter]`
- `[SkinDriver]`
- `[SkinUser]`

Additionally, it is possible to efficiently iterate over all sensors of skin or a user, which are of a specific type.

```
X::forEachSensorOfType(SkinSensorTypeId, SkinCallback<Sensor> c)
```

The behavior of the iteration functions and callbacks are the same as their C counterparts.  See
`[skin_for_each_Y](skin)` and [callbacks](skin_callback).

TYPE SkinCallback: std::function<int (Object)>
	A callback for iterating over an object

	Equivalent of `[skin_callback_X](skin_callback)`.
