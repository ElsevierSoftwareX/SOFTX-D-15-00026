This structure holds statistics gathered by a reader.  The time durations calculated are CPU time if the underlying
real-time system permits, and wall-clock time otherwise.  Furthermore, the times also include synchronization time.

VARIABLE start_time: urt_time
	The start time of the task

	This is the reader's start time.

VARIABLE worst_read_time: urt_time
	Worst case execution time of a reader cycle

	This is the worst case execution time of one cycle of the reader.  This includes time spent in synchronization.

VARIABLE best_read_time: urt_time
	Best case execution time of a reader cycle

	This is the best case execution time of one cycle of the reader.  This includes time spent in synchronization.

VARIABLE accumulated_read_time: urt_time
	Accumulated execution time of reader cycles

	This is the sum of execution time of each cycle of the reader.  The average execution time can be calculated
	by dividing this value with `[#read_count]`.

VARIABLE read_count: uint64_t
	Number of data frames read

	This is the number of times the reader has read data from the writers, i.e. the number of unpaused cycles since
	the reader was born.
