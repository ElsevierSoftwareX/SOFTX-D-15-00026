This structure is used to provide callbacks to and regarding a user.

VARIABLE peek: (struct skin_user *, skin_sensor_response *, skin_sensor_size, void *): void
	The callback that reads sensor responses

	This callback is indirectly called by the user's reader (similar to `[#read](skin_reader_callbacks)`)
	when new data is available.  It is given the user object, the sensor responses memory to read from, the
	[number of sensors](skin_user#skin_user_sensor_count) present and [user provided data](#user_data).

VARIABLE init: (struct skin_user *, void *): void
	The callback to call when the user is created

	This callback is called if the user is successfully created, before the generic user init [hook](skin_hook)
	is called, and is given the user object as well as [user provided data](#user_data).

	This callback is optional.

VARIABLE clean: (struct skin_user *, void *): void
	The callback to call when the user is removed

	This callback is called when the user is removed, after the generic user clean [hook](skin_hook)
	is called, and is given the user object as well as [user provided data](#user_data).

	**Note**: when this callback is called, the user's reader is already removed.  At this point only
	`[data iterators](skin_user#skin_user_for_each_X)` are available.

	This callback is optional.

VARIABLE reader_init: (struct skin_reader *, void *): void
	The callback to call when the user's reader is created

	This callback is called if the user's reader is successfully created.
	See [reader's init callback](skin_reader_callbacks#init).  The user's reader is created before the user itself,
	and thus `[#skin_reader_get_user](skin_reader)` would return `NULL`.

	This callback is optional.

VARIABLE reader_clean: (struct skin_reader *, void *): void
	The callback to call when the user's reader is removed

	This callback is called when the user's reader is removed.
	See [reader's clean callback](skin_reader_callbacks#clean).  The user's reader is removed before the user itself.

	This callback is optional.

VARIABLE user_data: void *
	User provided data

	This is user provided data, given to all callbacks.
