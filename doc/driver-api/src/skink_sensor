The device driver needs to periodically acquire data from the sensors every time the [acquire callback](Callbacks#skink_device_acquire) is called. The `skink_sensor`
structure has many fields that are available to users, but not to the device drivers. The network driver can only access the variables described here.

VARIABLE response: skink_sensor_response
	The response of this sensor

	This is an array of responses, allowing Skinware to use multiple buffers for communication. Each time the [acquire callback](Callbacks#skink_device_acquire)
	is called, it is given a buffer parameter which must be used to put the sensor response in that location in this array. The sensor values must be mapped to
	`\[0, [#SKINK_SENSOR_RESPONSE_MAX](constants)]`.
