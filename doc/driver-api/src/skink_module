The device driver needs to describe the structure of the hardware it is handling to the skin kernel. As far as modules are concerned, it needs to fill in the fields
described here in the [details callback](Callbacks#skink_device_details).

VARIABLE sensors_count: skink_sensor_size
	Number of sensors in this module

	This is the number of sensors in this module. The device driver needs to fill this value for every module in each layer once and if the [details callback]
	(Callbacks#skink_device_details) is called.
