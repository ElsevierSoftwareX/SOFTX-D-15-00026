The device driver needs to describe the structure of the hardware it is handling to the skin kernel. As far as patches are concerned, it needs to fill in the fields
described here in the [details callback](Callbacks#skink_device_details).

VARIABLE modules_count: skink_module_size
	Number of modules in this patch

	This is the number of modules in this patch. The device driver needs to fill this value for every patch in each layer once and if the [details callback]
	(Callbacks#skink_device_details) is called.
