This is a C++ interface to `[skin_driver_callbacks]`.

TYPE detailsCallback: std::function<int (SkinDriver &, bool, SkinDriverDetails &)>
	The type of callback that provides/verifies the details of the skin structure

	This is the type of the callback that provides details of the skin structure (if new)
	or verifies it (if revived).  See `[skin_driver_callbacks::details](skin_driver_callbacks#details)`.

TYPE acquireCallback: std::function<int (SkinDriver &, SkinSensorResponse *, SkinSensorSize)>
	The type of callback that provides sensor responses

	This is the type of the callback that provides sensor responses.
	See `[skin_driver_callbacks::acquire](skin_driver_callbacks#acquire)`.

TYPE initCallback: std::function<void (SkinDriver &)>
	The type of callback to call when the driver is created

	This is the type of the callback to be called on driver creation.
	See `[skin_driver_callbacks::init](skin_driver_callbacks#init)`.

TYPE cleanCallback: std::function<void (SkinDriver &)>
	The type of callback to call when the driver is removed

	This is the type of the callback to be called on driver removal.
	See `[skin_driver_callbacks::clean](skin_driver_callbacks#clean)`.

TYPE writerInitCallback: std::function<void (SkinDriver &)>
	The type of callback to call when the driver's writer is created

	This is the type of the callback to be called on driver's writer creation.
	See `[skin_driver_callbacks::writer_init](skin_driver_callbacks#writer_init)`.

TYPE writerCleanCallback: std::function<void (SkinDriver &)>
	The type of callback to call when the driver's writer is removed

	This is the type of the callback to be called on driver's writer removal.
	See `[skin_driver_callbacks::writer_clean](skin_driver_callbacks#writer_clean)`.
