previous struct skin_reader
next struct skin_object
seealso `[skin_reader]`

This simple struct holds statistics for [data acquisition threads](skin_reader#skin_reader_start). From the
[reader](skin_object#skin_object_reader), the `[#tasks_statistics](skin_reader)` array can be indexed with layer id to retrieve these statistics for each
layer individually. Remember that a layer refers to sensors of a [sensor type](skin_sensor_type).

VARIABLE worst_read_time: skin_rt_time
	Worst case execution time of the reader thread

	This variable will hold the worst case execution time of the reader thread for this layer. The type
	`[#skin_rt_time](skin_rt)` is the same as RTAI's `RTIME`.

VARIABLE best_read_time: skin_rt_time
	Best case execution time of the reader thread

	This variable will hold the best case execution time of the reader thread for this layer. The type
	`[#skin_rt_time](skin_rt)` is the same as RTAI's `RTIME`.

VARIABLE accumulated_read_time: skin_rt_time
	Accumulated execution time of the reader thread

	This variable will hold the sum of execution time of each cycle of the reader thread for this layer since its beginning.
	The type `skin_rt_time` is the same as RTAI's `RTIME`. Divided by `[#number_of_reads]`, an average execution time
	can be obtained. Note however that these values are updated with every read so in an unfortunate
	case, the two variables may not refer to the same timestamp.

VARIABLE number_of_reads: uint64_t
	Number of frames read by the reader thread since its start

	This variable will hold the number of times the reader has read data since beginning of execution.
