The calibration cache contains information necessary for calibrating the skin. The format of this file is as follows. The texts in parentheses are commentary
and should not be included in the cache.

```
sensors-count  total-neighbors-count
(sensors-count&times;)
    (3&times;)position
    (3&times;)orientation
    (2&times;)flattened-position
    radius
    robot-link
    neighbors-count
    (neighbors-count&times;)
        neighbors
```

In this format:
  - `sensors-count` shows the number of sensors in the skin.
  - `total-neighbors-count` is the sum of all `neighbors-count` of all sensors. The value is here for preallocation of memory.
  - `position` consists of `x`, `y` and `z` values of the position of the sensor, relative to the robot link it is located on.
  - `orientation` consists of `x`, `y` and `z` values of the normal to the skin at the position of sensor, relative to the robot link it is located on.
  - `flattened-position` consists of `x` and `y` values of the sensor after flattening the skin.
  - `radius` is the radius of the sensor (assuming it's a circle or a sphere)
  - `robot-link` an id assigned by the calibrator program to the robot link the sensor is located on.
  - `neighbors-count` number of neighbors assigned to this sensor during flattening of the skin.
  - `neighbors` id of neighbors of the sensor.

As an example, the corresponding cache file to [A hypothetical flat skin on robot link 0](svg files/calibration.svg) which is an already flat
skin (on robot link 0) would be:
