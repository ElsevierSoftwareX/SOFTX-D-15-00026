This structure is used to configure a writer, whether standalone or of a driver.

VARIABLE buffer_size: size_t
	Size of data buffer

	This is the size of data the writer is going to provide.  In the case of drivers, this size is automatically
	calculated and is therefore unused.

VARIABLE buffer_count: uint8_t
	Number of data buffers

	This is the number of buffers to use for transferring data to readers.  The higher the number of buffers,
	the more memory is consumed, but the less chances of synchronization difficulties, such as [swap skips]
	(skin_writer_statistics#swap_skips)

VARIABLE name: const char *
	The name of the writer

	This is the name with which the writer (and the driver) is identified.  At most `URT_NAME_LEN - 3` characters
	are taken from this name.
