This is a C++ interface to [hooks](skin_hook).  The callbacks of the type defined here are set as object initialization
and clean up hooks.

The functions setting the hooks have the following general form:

```
Skin::setXEHook(struct skin *, skin_hook_X, data)
```

In this representation, `X` is the object the hook is being set for and `E` is the event.  The events are the following.

- Init
- Clean

The classes that can be hooked are the following.

- `[SkinSensor]`
- `[SkinModule]`
- `[SkinPatch]`
- `[SkinReader]`
- `[SkinWriter]`
- `[SkinDriver]`
- `[SkinUser]`

TYPE SkinHook: std::function<void (Object)>
	A callback for object event

	Equivalent of `[skin_hook_X](skin_hook)`.
