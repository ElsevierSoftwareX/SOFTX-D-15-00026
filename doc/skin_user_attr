This structure is used to configure a user.  A user attaches to a driver and takes the skin information from the driver.
If the user's [reader attributes](skin_reader_attr) identify the driver, the user attribute is unused.  Otherwise,
a driver satisfying these attributes is found to be attached to.

VARIABLE sensor_type: skin_sensor_type_id
	The sensor type to look for in a driver

	When [attaching to a driver](skin#skin_driver_attach), if a name is given with the [reader attribute]
	(skin_reader_attr#name), the driver is idenitifed by that name and this field is unused.  Otherwise,
	the drivers are searched for one that provides a sensor of this type (and that is not already attached
	to).  The user then attempts to attach to that driver.

	See also `[#skin_sensor_type_size](skin)`.
