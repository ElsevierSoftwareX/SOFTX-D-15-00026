Building and Installation of Skinware
=====================================

    0. Overview
    -----------

See README for prerequisites of building Skinware.  Then proceed with
configuration, build and installation of Skinware as instructed in this file.
See section 3 (Usage) of README for instructions on how Skinware should be set
up and how it can be used.

Table of contents:
1) Configuration
2) Build
3) Installation

    1. Configuration
    ----------------

The configuration of Skinware is similar to that of the Linux kernel.  You can
configure Skinware with any of the following methods:

    $ make oldconfig
    $ make config
    $ make menuconfig
    $ make gconfig
    $ make xconfig

Each option in the configuration has an associated help messages.  The
following are some of the most important options:

- Developer mode: If you are not a developer of Skinware, simply turn this
  option off.
- General/Installation directory: Where Skinware will be installed.
- General/RTAI configuration tool: Path to rtai-config of RTAI package.
- General/Documentation: If you need to build the documentation yourself.
- Modules/Drivers: Which drivers to build.

    2. Build
    --------

After configuration, simply write

    $ make

At this stage, there should be no error if all prerequisites have been
installed.  If there was an error, it means that you are missing some
prerequisite, which you can double check with README.  Unfortunately, I'm
not yet proficient enough to write an autoconfig script (I would when I find
the time), so for now, bare with me.

    3. Installation
    ---------------

As root, simply write

    $ make install

to install Skinware at the configured location.  A link to skin-config script
will be made in `/usr/bin`, hopefully in your PATH so it can be accessed from
anywhere.

If at any point you needed to uninstall Skinware, again as root, execute

    $ make uninstall

which removes all installed files.  If you have created any files in the
installation directory, they will be left intact.
