					Things to remember upon release
					===============================

Here are the things that you must make sure are done before you release a new version:

- update the kernel and library versions in Makefile.common
- check the documentation files and see if they are of an older version.  If so, update them and update their version also.
- in the documentation, SKIN[K]_VERSION should be updated
